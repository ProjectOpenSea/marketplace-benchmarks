 * @dev When true, ETH/native payments are not accepted, and only ERC-20 payment methods can be used.
 * @dev **collectionLevelOffer**: Denotes that the offer that was accepted was at the collection level.  When `true`,
 * @dev the Buyer should be prompted to sign the the collection offer approval stucture.  When false, the Buyer should
 * @dev prompted to sign the offer approval structure.
 * @dev **protocol**: 0 for ERC-721 or 1 for ERC-1155.  See `TokenProtocols`.
 * @dev **paymentCoin**: `address(0)` denotes native currency sale.  Otherwise ERC-20 payment coin address.
 * @dev **tokenAddress**: The smart contract address of the ERC-721 or ERC-1155 token being sold.
 * @dev **seller**: The seller/current owner of the token.
 * @dev **privateBuyer**: `address(0)` denotes a listing available to any buyer.  Otherwise, this denotes the privately
 * @dev designated buyer.
 * @dev **buyer**: The buyer/new owner of the token.
 * @dev **delegatedPurchaser**: Allows a buyer to delegate an address to buy a token on their behalf.  This would allow
 * @dev a warm burner wallet to purchase tokens and allow them to be received in a cold wallet, for example.
 * @dev **marketplace**: The address designated to receive marketplace fees, if applicable.
 * @dev **marketplaceFeeNumerator**: Marketplace fee percentage.  Denominator is 10,000.

 * @dev **listingNonce**: The nonce the seller signed in the listing.
 * @dev **offerNonce**: The nonce the buyer signed in the offer.
 * @dev **listingMinPrice**: The minimum price the seller signed off on, in wei.  Buyer can buy above,
 * @dev but not below the seller-approved minimum price.
 * @dev **offerPrice**: The sale price of the matched order, in wei.  Buyer signs off on the final offer price.
 * @dev **listingExpiration**: The timestamp at which the listing expires.
